  Each project is a new floral journey and fabulous encounters. Let yourself embark on this wonderful journey, this piece of road that we can travel together.  <br/><br/>
  <strong>
    I specialize in weddings and funerary compositions.</strong> These are two different horizons but I am passionate about it.
  <br/><br/>

  Do not hesitate to walk in my floral world for a moment and above all, take the time to think about what <strong>YOU</strong> want <br/>
  We can then think about it together and give our wishes and our tastes.
  <br/>

  Each person is different, I am listening and trying to offer the best for unique and lively compositions, which you will remember.
  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
  Every job is different. There is indeed a lot of possibilities, choices, materials.
  <br/><br/>
  Each flower has a symbolism and can take you to very different places, just as surprising ... In exceptional places that you may not know yet.
  <br/><br/>
  I'm here to go with you. I am listening to you and especially present for each questioning. Do not hesitate!
